_In a meeting with al-Jareedah ar-Ra’iy, a Kuwaiti national newspaper [Dated 19th December 1998, Edition 11503]_

The Allaamah of Yemen Shaykh Muqbil said:

> “I free myself, before Allaah, from Usaamah bin Laadin. He is a calamity and a trial for the Muslims (Ummah) and his actions are wicked!”

In the same meeting the Shaykh was asked:

**Question:**

> “It is noticed that the Muslims in the west are subjected to hardship once a bomb goes off, no matter where in the world it occurs”

**Answer:**

> “I am aware of this. Some of our brothers from Britain called me complaining about the difficulty that they face, and they asked if it is ok for them to openly proclaim their disavowal from Usaamah bin Ladin. So we said to them, we have freed ourselves from him and his activities a long time ago, and the actuality (that which has taken place in the world) testifies that the Muslims in the west are faced with difficulties due to these movements which are supported by the ‘bankrupt brotherhood’ (Ikhwaan al-Muslimoon) and other then them, and Allaah’s aid is sought.'”

- The Shaykh gives an emphatic warning from deviation of bin Ladin, indeed it is the people of knowledge who are the people of insight and understanding, they are the ones able to see fitan years before they manifest themselves.
- Reflect upon the words of Shaykhul-Islaam ’Abdul-’Azeez Ibn ’Abdullaah Ibn Baaz (d.1420H) – rahimahullaah when he said in 1996, “So my advice to al-Mas’aree, al-Faqeeh and Ibn Ladin and all those who traverse their way is to leave alone this disastrous path, and to fear Allaah and to beware of His revenge and His anger, and to return to guidance and to repent to Allaah from whatever has preceded from them ” . Yet the likes of al-Mas’aree and al-Faqeeh are granted ‘political asylum’ in the UK. Al-Mas’aree residing in London since 1994 being free to propagate his diseased ideology, so ponder!
